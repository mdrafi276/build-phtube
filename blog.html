         <h1 class="text-2xl  text-black"> <span class="font-extrabold">Ans:</span>IThe scope of var, let, and const are totally different, var is function scoped, meaning it can only be accessed within the function where it is declared, or globally if it is declared outside any function.
          
          const variables are also block-scoped like let but const variables cannot be reassigned after they are initially assigned a value. However, for objects and arrays declared with const, their properties or elements can be modified, but the variable itself cannot be reassigned.  </h1><br>

          <h1 class="text-2xl text-black"><span class="  font-extrabold ">Ans:</span> null and undefined are two of the primitive and false values in JavaScript that represent the absence of a meaningful value. They can be used for different purposes depending on the context. null is used to indicate that a variable has been explicitly assigned no value, or that an object property or an array element does not exist. undefined is used to indicate that a variable has not been declared, or that an object property or an array element has not been assigned any value, or that a function parameter has not been provided, or that a function does not return any value. </h1><br>

          <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What do you mean by REST API?</h1><br>
          <h1 class="text-2xl text-black "> <span class="font-extrabold">Ans:</span> REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is a style of web API that follows certain design principles and conventions to allow applications and servers to communicate and exchange data using HTTP and HTTPS methods. A REST API typically exposes resources through uniform resource identifiers that can be accessed and manipulated by clients using HTTP or HTTPS methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, etc. A REST API also supports different data formats for the request and response bodies, such as JSON, XML, HTML, etc.  </h1>
